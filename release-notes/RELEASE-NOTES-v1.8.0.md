## :zap: Split release notes by release number 
###### 2021-10-30

### Changes
<!-- Specify changes you've done in your PR, be as specific as you can! :) -->

Now we are splitting release notes by release number instead of timestamp, this help us avoid unnecessary files creation.

To improve experience we've changed default value of `useLast` to `2` so we get release-notes from the second latest release to the latest one, and we use latest release number in file name.
