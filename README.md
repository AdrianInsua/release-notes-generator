**RELEASE NOTES GENERATOR** automates the creation of a customized release note.

This is not a changelog generator, it will not generate simple changelog notes abot what changes
are included, instead of this a complete .MD file will be created with a custom text where you can
explain your newest changes deeply.

This project was born to automate the communication between developers and final users.


## How Release Notes are done

- Parse every PR since last RELEASE.
- Include all PR description's markdown in `RELEASE-NOTE.md`
- The parsing will use PR's labels for:
	- Filter wich labels will be used in `RELEASE-NOTES.md`. i.e: `type/releas-note`
	- Mark Release note section as feature, bug, refactor, etc.
- If you set `CI` flag all changes will be commited to your repo.


## Supported Repos

Currently we are only supporting **GITHUB**.
